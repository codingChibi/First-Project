# First-Project

This is my First ever project after 1 month learning python

I have repeat lines of code which basically mean i copy the one block of codes and paste it in another block and so on.

You can reduce the length of the code especially the if-else / if-elif statements which occupies a large portion of my code

If you can find some codes which i can further reduce, please do so. I'd appreciate it a lot.

If you can also improve some things that needs to be improved and add items / options for the user, please do so also.

Thanks!!!

=============================================

This program extract data from the CSV and can also sort branches that have the same status and show it to the user.

What this code do are:

It will ask the user What task he want to do:
1- Show 1 branch Status
2- Show all Branch Status

**If the user input 1**, it will prompt the user to enter a branch code from the csv

After entering a branch code,it will prompt the user to select items from the branch code that he wants to see:

1- Equipment A

2- Equipment B

3- Equipment C

4- Equipment D

5 - Activity A

6 - Show all

After selecting an item, it will display the dataframe of user's chosen branch code.

**If the user input 2**, it will prompt the user to select an item that he wants to show, for all branches:

1- Equipment A

2- Equipment B

3- Equipment C

4- Equipment D

5 - Activity A

After selecting an item, it will prompt the user to select a status for that item.

After selecting status for that item, it will display a table of all branches with the same status.
